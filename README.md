## 📋 Overview

Text Analyzer is a web-based application that performs various text analysis operations on user-provided text. It was developed as part of an assignment for Sir Hamza's class, demonstrating the use of Python data types, operators, keywords, string casting, and string methods.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Basic Analysis
- **Word Count**: Calculates the total number of words in the text
- **Character Count**: Counts all characters including spaces
- **Vowel Count**: Identifies and counts all vowels (a, e, i, o, u)
- **Python Check**: Verifies if the text contains the word "Python"

### 🔍 Search and Replace
- Search for specific words or phrases in the text
- Replace them with alternative text
- Count occurrences of the search term

### 🔄 Text Transformations
- Convert text to UPPERCASE
- Convert text to lowercase
- Transform text to Title Case
- Reverse the entire text

### 📈 Advanced Metrics
- Calculate average word length
- Count sentences in the text
- Analyze word frequency with visual charts
